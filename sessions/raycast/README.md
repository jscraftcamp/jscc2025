# Raycast User Group / Tips & Tricks
- Mostly discussed Michael's setup with Karabiner Elements and its advantages (see [Michael's configuration repo](https://github.com/LBBO/karabiner-config), [the original configuration repo](https://github.com/mxstbr/karabiner), and [the corresponding "What's in my Raycast" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5MDv9qwhU8)])
  - Replaces Caps Lock with "Hyper Key" for guaranteed conflict-free custom shortcuts
  - Creates two-layer shortcuts for basically anything and then uses them to trigger most Raycast functionality
  - Uses TypeScript to conveniently generate Karabiner configuration
- Discussed usage of Snippets & Quick links and their parametrisation (see https://manual.raycast.com/dynamic-placeholders)
