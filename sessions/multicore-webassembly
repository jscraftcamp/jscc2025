# Multicore Webassembly
## Why
* Full Audio Synthesis with low latency in the webbrowser
* High performance Vector Calculations of much data in the webbrowser (search engine)
* Low lattency Sound visualizer in the webbrowser
* why not?

## Problems and Solutions
* Avoid copy data - use shared memory with SharedArrayBuffer - must be enabled via header due to security issues (rowhammer)
* multicore handling complex (in C)- use rust with rayon https://github.com/kyr0/wasm-bindgen-rayon
* sometimes js jit optimization possible and faster than wasm

* real time process priority for sound in the browser - new browser api AudioWorkletProcessor https://ringbuf-js.netlify.app/
