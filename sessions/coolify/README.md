# Coolify Deployment

- Bring your own server, then Coolify manages it
- Demoed setup of well-known projects
- Demoed git-repo-based deployment
	- Supports dockerfile
	- Also supports automatic deployment detection via nixpacks or so
- Contains logging and monitoring, including notifications for downtime or resource threshold exceeding
- Offers very easy terminal access, both on server and on app level
- Offers preview environments
- Alerts you of necessary updates
- Offers "intended" workflows but also has escape hatches like dockerfiles for when you want more control

## TL;DR
- Reduced a lot of headache, both in personal and professional use
- One participant reduced cost by 40-50% by moving from serverless to reserved AWS instances (?) since they knew what kind of usage they were expecting and could plan for that
